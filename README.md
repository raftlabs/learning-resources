  In this course, You'll work with declaration files and types, and learn to test pure type information. You'll build a Slack app with a data layer that balances performance and safety and includes automatic detection of API surface changes. By the end of this course, you'll be able to manage even the most ambitious Typescript projects with confidence and ease.

#### Understanding & Mastering Git

At RaftLabs, we use Git for version control. All our repositories are on Github. We use pull request approach and hence it is very important for you to understand this approach. If you have used this approach in your past companies, still please go through the course as a refresher. If you have not used this approach before, make sure you understand the concepts throughly.

- Git for Beginners - [This course](<https://raftlabs-engineering.notion.site/Frontend-087b37b7edab40469986e6d1bfece1ce#:~:text=Git%20(1%20day)-,Git%20for%20Beginners,-(4%20hours)%20%2D%20This>) is for those who are extremely new to Git and need to learn the basic concepts. It covers how to set up Git in your system and set up SSH, etc.

- Using Github with VS Code - In [this course](https://youtu.be/LdSwWxVzUpo), you will learn how to use Github neatly with VS Code. We use GitHub internally, and we want to save our developers time by not having to go to the browser to create a pull request and get it reviewed by the manager. Instead, you can do that directly in VSCode.
